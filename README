Exim Spam Catcher

A small script to build a hosts.deny file based on entries in the Exim reject logs.

The script looks at headers for multiple reject.log files (if you are rotating your
reject logs).  If an IP shows up as being rejected by spamassassin more than the
$threshold (in the script), then it is added to the host.deny file.

Add this script into the crontab for root.

Assumed:

  + You are using exim4.
  + You are using spamassassin.
  + Your exim reject logs are in /var/log/exim/

You can create a /etc/hosts.default.deny file that includes things that are fixed
which will be included in the final hosts.deny file.
